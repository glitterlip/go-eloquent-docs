Welcome to the GoEloquent documentation. If you encounter any problems when using GoEloquent, have a look at the  [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.html), raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues).

## What is GoEloquent?

When moving from Laravel to golang , interact with mysql using Golang always drives me crazy. Some Golang ORM framework do provide a query builder like Laravel although it's a little different.    
But what I really missing is the Laravel's Eloquent Orm. So I decide to create another orm framework like Laravel Eloquent Orm.

## Installation

`go get github.com/glitterlip/go-eloquent`
